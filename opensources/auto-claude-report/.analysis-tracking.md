### Architecture Analysis

**Architecture Style:** Multi-Agent Orchestration with Spec-Driven Development

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Multi-Agent Pattern**: Specialized agents (Planner, Coder, QA Reviewer, QA Fixer)
2. **Spec-Driven Development**: 3-8 phase pipeline based on complexity
3. **Factory Pattern**: `create_client()` for Claude SDK configuration
4. **Registry Pattern**: `AGENT_CONFIGS` for tool permissions
5. **State Machine Pattern**: Build lifecycle management
6. **Recovery Manager Pattern**: Session recovery and retry logic

**Module Structure:**
- `apps/backend/`: Python CLI and agent logic
  - `core/`: Client, auth, security, workspace
  - `agents/`: Agent implementations
  - `spec_agents/`: Spec creation agents
  - `integrations/`: Graphiti, Linear, GitHub
  - `prompts/`: Agent system prompts (.md files)
  - `qa/`: QA loop implementation
- `apps/frontend/`: Electron desktop application
  - `src/main/`: Electron main process
  - `src/renderer/`: React UI components

**Security Architecture:**
- Three-layer defense: OS Sandbox, Filesystem Permissions, Command Allowlist
- Dynamic tool permissions per agent type
- Git worktree isolation for safe experimentation
- OAuth token authentication (no direct API keys)

### Use Cases

**Main Problem Solved:** Automating complex software development workflows requiring planning, implementation, validation, and integration.

**Primary Use Cases:**
1. Autonomous Feature Development (plan → implement → validate)
2. GitHub/GitLab Issue Resolution
3. Codebase Investigation and Bug Fixing
4. Parallel Multi-Service Development (up to 12 agents)
5. Code Refactoring and Migration

**Target User Personas:**
1. Solo Developer / Freelancer
2. Development Team Lead / Engineering Manager
3. Enterprise Developer / DevOps Engineer
4. Open Source Maintainer

**Supported Deployment Contexts:**
1. Local Development (Desktop app)
2. CI/CD Integration (Headless CLI)
3. Team Environment (Linear integration)
4. Self-Hosted

### Evaluation

**Strengths:**
- Robust multi-agent architecture with specialized agents
- Three-layer security model with dynamic command allowlisting
- Git worktree isolation for safe feature development
- Self-validating QA loop (up to 50 iterations)
- Graphiti memory system for cross-session context
- Native Claude Agent SDK integration
- Cross-platform desktop app (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Comprehensive CLI for headless operation
- Strong developer tooling (pre-commit, testing)
- Excellent documentation (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Weaknesses:**
- Claude-exclusive dependency (no multi-LLM support)
- High system requirements (Python 3.12+, Node.js 24+)
- Complex memory system setup (multiple API keys)
- Steep learning curve for multi-layered architecture
- Token consumption with extended thinking modes
- Resource-intensive parallel execution
- No offline mode available
- Limited enterprise features (no multi-user, audit logging)
- GitLab support secondary to GitHub

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Parallel agents: Up to 12 terminals
- Project size: Medium-large codebases (context window limits)
- Session duration: Hours to days with recovery
- Complexity tiers: Simple (3 phases) to Complex (8 phases)
